## Notes
Greatest common divisor

### Factorization
Computing Primes
- is overkill for gcd
-

GCD(a,b) -> if b < a ->GCD(a,b) = GCD(b,a)
a = qb + r
means a = quotient * b + remainder
call GCD of two numbers g
a - qb = r
Covers Euclids algorithm, mentions recursion + terminal case
```
function EuclidGCD(a,b)
Input: a, b (nonnegative integers)
Output: gcd(a,b)
while b ≠ 0 do
Remainder = a mod b
a = b
b = Remainder
endwhile
return(a)
end EuclidGCD
```
start thinking about time complexity any time you see an algorithm
smallest quotient is one
worst possible is to subsequent fibonachi values


RSA uses GCD to ensure somekind of security

Polynomial Definition:
coefficients with constants multipled by themselves
monomial

Polynomial approximate nearly every function we know in mathematics

Horners rules
- rewerite the algorithm to create more efficient implementation
- number of multiplications is the degreen of x^n

```
function HornerEval(a[0:n],v)
Input: a[0:n] (an array of real numbers), v (a real number)
Output: the value of the polynomial anxn + an – 1xn – 1 + . . . + a1x + a0
at x = v
Sum ← a[n]
for i ← n – 1 downto 0 do
Sum ← Sum * v + a[i]
endfor
return(Sum)
end HornerEval
```
