# Efficient Polynomial Multiplication
```
( a_0 + a_1*x + a_2*x^2 ) * (b_0 + b_1 * x +b_2*x^2)
= a_0*b_0 + (a_0*b_1 +a_1*b_0)x + a_0*b_2+a_1*b_1+a_2*b_0)x^2 + (a_1*b_2+a_2*b_1)x^3 + a_2*b_2*x^4

```

To reduce the number of terms computed, we compute the central values (a_i * b_j + ...)
into a singular computation

We do this by doing Q_1(x)*P_1(x) - P_2(x)*Q_2(x)

Question does this actually work in computer?
- division is more expensive, but this is still faster

Used for RSA, general encryption
Numbers too big to store in a computer

# Mismatched Polynomial Multiplication

Reduce the larger polynomial to the smaller's size
Such is Q(x)'s largest term is x^1000
And P(x)'s largest term is x^100
Q(x) becomes Q(x)_1 + Q(x)_2 + ... + Q(x)_9 + Q(x)_10
