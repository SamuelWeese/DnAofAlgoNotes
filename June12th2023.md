### Binary Search Tree
Deletion in binary search Tree
# Tree sort

Uses in order traversal of a binary

W(n) is number of levels -> max levels is number of elements in a list

Inserting element into already constructed tree is O(n), where n is levels
O(n^2) for constructing a binary search tree -> worst case is an already sorted case


Best case for insertion is log(n), best for construction is O(n log(n))
# Ternary Tree
Knuth Transformation - a transformation between ternary to binary tree
Data is not sorted by this method

# Parent Array representation
Label the non binary tree in any way you want
Record the relationship between parent and children
creates 2d array, mapping roots

## Tree Truths
These are true for all trees
(Slide Deck 11)
Number of edges (m) is always 1 less than nodes (n)

Basis Step -> a tree with 1 node has no edges
This is true because each edge must have 2 nodes
Induction is the way to go when proving broad things
Remember, trees are always acyclic
