### Performance Methods
asymptote
## 5 notations

#

# Big Oh Notation
O(g(n)) f (n) is bounded above by a scale of g(n)
- this is the inverse of Omega Notation
# Omega Notation
Omega(g(n)) f(n) is bounded below by a scale of g(n)
- this is the inverse of Big Oh notation


# Theta Notation
Theta(g(n)) - f(n) is bounded above and below by a scale of g(n)
- ie dominant term is the same for both functions, or scaled by constant


# Little Oh Notation

example
- f(n) = log(n+1)
- g(n) = n
- therefor lim(log(n+1)/n) = 0

# Asymptotic Notation
g(n) is asymptotically equivalant to f(n)
- ie f(n) = g(n) + 5

For C in omega and big oh

# Theorem 3.1.2 Ratio Limit Test
Let f(n), g(n) of set F. If the limit of the ratio f(n)/g(n) exists as n tends to infinity, then f and g are comparable. Moreover, assuming L = limn→􏰂f(n)/g(n) exists, then the following results hold.
- 1. 0 < L < => f(n) of Theta(g(n)), f and g have the same order
- 2. L = 0 => Oh(f(n)) for Oh(g(n)), f has a smaller order than g
- 3. L = 􏰂 􏰃 O(g(n)) 􏰅 O(f(n)), f has a larger order than g
