why is it evident that algorithm is correct?

how do algorithms relate to malformed problems?
- make the problem formed
mean cloud movement - algorithm depends on this
stochastic calc -
random -properties of that object
How do you get correct (constistant) - then find that problem
stochastic gradient descent - in ML, look at examples
algorithm involves specific task
- list of numbers
- how you order this list matters

How do I do so well in this class I can teach it?
2 THINGS STUDENT MUST LEARN
- Thorough understanding of the subject
    - Algorithm design and correctness
    - Don't just follow, but create answers
    - Experimental step of learning
- Level of depth
    -
    - traversal of how everything (idea wise and in the universe) is linked

Why is there this split between Data Structure and efficiency? Aren't these tied at an inseperable level?

How do we create a problem which is hard to reverse? Even when algo is known? How does random seeding fit into this?
- all algorithms must be obfuscated
- one way functions exist, we don't have a way of proving themWe I’m
- not provable
Does knowing n in mod n result in attacks having a 1/n chance of success per attack? Binomial trial ((bernuoilli))
- security is usually based on number security -> physics, ect

Can I get HW early?

How are merge sort and binary search different? Are they simply inverses of the same process?
more nuace
Is there any algorithm with a best case complexity that is not B(n) = 1?
Depends on what identify basic operations to be
IE given number, asked if this is prime number? not one operations
IE given matrix, is this matrix nonsingular?

Is it ever faster to discard outliers when using interpolation search? Does this always defeat the purpose of interpo seach?
Look up proof of n log(n)
Is it worth searching for outliers before running the search, or even stopping the search to run a separate search? (Gambler's quit before hitting gold analogy)
There are cases,


Is there any valid or real world algorithms which use additional values, not just high and low?
Depends on distribution, no well known algorithm

Is increasing linearly only if it increases at the same rate
- not nessicarligy smae value
- f(x) = 2x
- linearly is no curve
    - formally linearly 2 properties
    f(x) =additivity
    Additivity: f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) (is more important)
    Homogeneity of degree 1: f(αx) = α f(x) for all α.
    - functions which satisfy Additivity but not Homogeneity
    - just for functions


operations vs iterations
number of iterations used
matrix operations examples


How did we get the formula for average? Is the p_i properly stated as a pdf
Is there ever a best time complexity smaller than O(1)? (sgetting to it)
Sigma P_i vs variance thought, I am over thinking, investigate later

Why do we track comparisons but not assignment? In C++ isn't assignment slower than comparison?

Is there ever a case for not N (real positive)? I assume in the real world there isn't due to our measurments being all incremental/positive in adding?

Is there a discrete form of measurement between these 5? I would assume big O vs Theta is not always equivalant like ~ or Omega?
transitive discrete method

is it possible to bound it by O (n log n/2 + 1) instead of n log n?
yes, but n log n is sufficient

Ask about how much I talk

Is drop smallest vs largest a good general rule for  bounding any series?\
- bread and butter
-
in general what are the step + books I should go after to be able to prove
- creative mind comes in -> no one path
- approximation is an art
- area of approximation
- understand named equalities
- use this to prove complex bounds
- good calculus text book -> inequalities
- am > gm inequalities
ask about discord server stuff (specifically cheating preventative measures)

ask about camera
- yea thats fine
review calculus 2
