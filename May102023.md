### x^p problem
arrival at 10:30 precisely
binary solution
change of TA
Major design strategies
- greedy method
- divide and conquer
    - breaking down into smaller parts
    - mentions binary search during this

- dynamic programming
    - my understanding is using recursion and hashing together
    -
* Below used for graphs *
mentions dfs and bfs
I became bored here
- backtracking
    -
- branch and bound

x^p is also x^(2(p/2))-> we see a recursive structure emerge here
Edge cases are realitively easily overlooked
sufficiently large cases

One way functions
- computing output from inputs is easy
- inverwsion and reverse engineering is hard
Diffie-Hellman Key exchange

|p1|x|x|
|x^p1|x^p1 mod n||x^p1 mod n|
|x^p2|x^p2 mod n|x^p2 mod n|

TODO look up modulo order of operations and communtivity

- pgp and encryption
