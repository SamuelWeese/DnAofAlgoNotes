### Prim's Algorithm

Looks at cut of T and T compliment

Naive version of Prim's algorithm is n^3

Very similar to Dijkstra's algorithm

# Prim Complexity

Naive: Theta(n^3)
Using a priority queue: theta(n log m), or theta (m log n)
where m is number of edges, and n is vertices

### Shortest path problem

Breadth first search - finds shortest by definition
Depth first search returns any path

### Dijkstra's algorithm
find cheapest edge connection of a and c, then search c
repeat until you find b


# Huffman's Algorithm

# question regarding krushals

What is the cost of finding a loop? Is it n_1, where n_1 is all values in the current list?
Is that worst, and basically just a linear search? Is there a faster way?
