# Initial polynomial

P(x) = 1-2x+3x^2+6x^3
Q(x) = 1+x^2 + 9x^3
# Pad
Pad them out:
~ P(x) = 1 - 2x + 3x^2 + 6x^3 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0
~ Q(x) = 1 + x^2 + 9x^3 + 0 + 0 + 0


# Use DFT (calculated outside class)
DFT_omega_8 (~P(x))= [8, -4.6569 + 5.8284i, -2-8i, 6.6569 - 0.1716i, 0, 6.6569+ 0.1716i, -2 + 8i, -4.6569 + 5.8284i]
DFT_omega_8 (~Q(x)) = [11, -5.364 + 7.364i, -9i, 7.364+5.364i, -7, 7.364 - 5.364i, 9i, -5.364 - 7.364i]
Multiply together ~= [1, -2, 4, 13, -15, 33, 54, 0]

# FFT below
Break into even and odd polynomial,
and use x^2 for the function

Even_P(x^2) =1 + 3x^2 + 0x^4 + 0x^6
Odd_P(x^2) = x(-2 + 6x^2 + 0x^4 + 0x^6)

Changing input from x^2 to x:

Even_P(x) =1 + 3x + 0x^2 + 0x^3
Odd_P(x) = -2 + 6x + 0x^2 + 0x^3

Starting polynomial must have n = 2^k, for x^n (even polynomial)
If odd polynomial, pad until power of two

# Complexity Recurrance Relation
k = log_2(n)
W(2^k) = 2(W(2^(k-1)))+2k

Substitution Yields:
2(W(2^(k-1)))+2k = 2[2W(2^(k-2))+2^(k-1)]+ 2^k
-> 2^(k-1) * W(2) + (k-1)*2^k
-> theta(k*2^k)
-> O(n*log_2(n))

# Recursive Breakdown
- usually stop breaking down at 1 (polynomial of degree 2 becomes 2 of degree 1)

NOTE: FFT will be covered quite basic
