### Greedy Paradigm, Optimal Sequential Storage, Knapsack Problem
pi is permutation
Sum of i = 1, n, P(pi(i)) (C_pi(1) + C_pi(2)+ ... C)


Cost of accessing is cumulative, ie accessing index 2 = + cost of 2 + cost of 1 + cost of 0

For a uniform access frequency, sort by of access, with cheap access first

Cost of Index / Probability index  is a general solution

### Minimums Spanning Tree
Identify edges within a graph by weight which allow you to create a spanning Tree
A spanning tree is a graph which connects every node in a tree to every other node

# Kruskal's Algorithm
Find the cheapest edge within the graph -> if it causes a cycle we remove it


Is it more or less expensive to prune edges which already have both vertices within our spanning graph?
