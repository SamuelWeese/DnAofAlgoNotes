### L'hospital's Rule

You know this, remember

lim_x->c f(x)/g(x) = lim_x->c f'(x)/g'(x)

f of x over g of x is same as f prime of x over g prime of x

example:

lim_x->c (5n^2 + 3n + 1) / (2n^2 + 7n + 5)
        =
lim_x->c (10n+3)/(4n+7)
        =
lim_x->c 10/4 = lim_x->c 5/2

// Insert tree here TODO SW

Road map of algorithm logically
Big O of something estimate, for
- look at operations done
    - find most numerous operation
    - use this to estimate number of operations (look at loop)
- apply mathematical logic to estimate
    - finally use l'hopitals to reduce, and use tree then

## Polynomial Complexity and Polynomial Results
Polynomial complexity algorithm - for size n, worst case complexity is n^y, where y is based on algo
Exponential complexity if worst case is a^n for some a
Written on board:
    An Algorithm A has polynomial complexity if its W_A(n) is Oh(n^d) for some d >= 0
    An algo has Exponential complexity if Oh(a^n) for a > 0
    Polynomial Complexity is better than Exponential complexity
        On(n^d) c_ Oh(a^n)
        Poly class  exponential class
    lim n-> inf n^d/a^n = lim n->inf dn^d-1/(a^n * log a)
    = lim (didn't finish writing)


## Harmonic Sum

Series of 1/n => limit is divergent
H_1 < H_2 < H_3 -> H_n < H_(n+1)
sub linear increase in size but decrease in increase

(1+1/2+1/3....+1/n) is equivalant to log n

integral n to 1 (1/x dx) = log n

piecewise aproximation of integral is a riemann sum

sandwiching -> sandwich smooth area between two regions of a riemann sum


O with lines below are little o, otherwise O is big O.

Riemann accuracy:

Upper bound by area of green (larger approximation)
Lower bound by area of blue (smaller approximation)
Harmonic sum is in between

Upper is Hn - 1/n
lower is Hn - 1

(Upper + lower) / 2 = (Hn-1/n + Hn - 1) / 2
log n + 1 >= Hn >= logn + 1/n

l'hopitals on upper and lower
lim n->inf <= lim n-> inf Hn/log_n  <= lim n-> inf log n + 1 / log n
1 <= hn <= 1
