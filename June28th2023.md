# Disjoint Sets

Disjoint set is multiple sets with no intersection

Using a forest as representation of disjoint set
- parent child are not related
- combine sets into

Parent array representation
- Each child has a parent
- follow the parent to find the correct set
- no edge cases due to complete coverage

How do I union 2 disjoint trees

Use the index list to point to only 1 negative, and the negative is the depth of the current tree
