No badri next week

6 assignments every couple of weeks (30%)

Monday after assignments is quizzes (15%)

Mid Term - Mid June (25%)

Final Exam - (30%)

50% is passing grade

Couple of bonus questions


## People

Mahima Dahiya - Grader, only escalate after talking to Mahima

## Textbook

Cormen Leiserson and Rivest Introduction to Algorithms - 79.23 cost on amazon

Ken Berman - Algorithms: Foundations
(is on SCRIBD: https://www.scribd.com/document/379384657/Algorithms-Berman )

### Warning

everything is individual

no collaberation

he is searching for it

10-15%

use public stuff

no chatgpt or chegg (non issue)

he will ask you to show in office

Here is the link, here is the answer, is acceptable

EVERYTHING MUST BE CITED


### Lecture
Algorithm is recipe
no ambiguity
Algorithm - unambiguous way of solving a problem, in a clear logical pattern

MUST be unambiguous

semi formal definintion

No formal definintion of Algorithm

algorithm is always a finite set of steps (formally)

formally could not have edge cases of infinite steps
## 3 important issues for designing an Algorithm

correctness -

Efficiency

Choice of Data Structure (Abstract Data Type)  -

Coin Problem
- Division
- Modulo
- Addition of returned values

How do we formalize problems  (like coin changing?)

given x change, return minimum value of a+b+c+d where 25(a)+10(b)+5(c)+1(d) = x

Proceeds to explain algorithm of floor division + modulo

This algorithm is greedy -

Greedy fashion -
- greedy disperse largest and ignore the rest
- failes with 11 cent coin and 15 cent change
    - disperses 11 cent then 4 pennies
    - vs 3 nickles, or better 1 dime 1 nickle

Using composition to to solve it

Could an optimal solution involve 3 or more dimes?
Could an optimal

NP Hard


### NP STUFF
READ MORE
NP Hard is harder than other stuff
No polynomial problem for solving NP Hard

### Mathematical tools
Induction
- proving infinitely many things by proving
    - base case
    - inductive step
    - syllogism - READ MORE
- recursion
    - base case
    - recurring step (inductive step), which is copy of base case
    - inductive step adds to base case some times



    Example of i_n things -> prove p1, p2 explicitly
    If Pi is know to be true, then Pi+1 must be true
Recursion
Asymptotic Notation
- big O
    constant: Θ(1)
    logarithmic: Θ(log N)
    linear: Θ(N)
    polynomial: Θ(N^2)
    exponential: Θ(2^N)
    factorial: Θ(N!)

Probability Theory
Graph Theory
- Graph -> when mentioned he means un

Major Design Strategies
- Greedy Method
- Divide and Conquore
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Branch and Bound
