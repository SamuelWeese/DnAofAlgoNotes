Variable length encoding
- fixed length encoding is when all bits have same length
    ```
    a = 0001
    b = 0011
    c = 0111
    d = 1111
    ```
    (or other permutations of such)
- variable length encoding
    - number of bits changes
    ```
     a = 0
     b = 10
     c = 110
     d = 1110
    ```
- prefix free encoding
    - same as variable but backwards?
    - IE
    ```
    a = 0
    b = 01
    c = 011
    d = 0111
    ```

# Prefix Free encoding
(this is Huffman algorithm)
- fixed length encoding
in practice we only want to write with prefix free code

# Huffman
- Find the frequency of characters
```
a = 10/44
b = 2/44
c = 6/44
d = 5
e = 4/44
f = 12/44
g = 5/44
```
Sort in decreasing order of weight (nlogn, where n is number of symbols we see)
```
f = 12
a = 10
c = 6
g = 5
d = 5
e = 4
b = 2
```
No sanctity in order of g/d
Combine the bottom two symbols

```
f = 12
a = 10
c = 6
g = 5
d = 5
be = 6
```
Sort again (n log n again, or more approperiatly n = n-1)
```
f = 12
a = 10
c = 6
be = 6
g = 5
d = 5
```
Combine bottom two
```
f = 12
a = 10
c = 6
be = 6
gd = 10
```
repeat sort/combine until
```
a-g = 44 (where a-g order is arbitrary, ie abcdefg is same as acdefbg)
```

Everytime you see a branch from a combination, label lower by 0, upper by 1
Trace all the way back to root

Ascii length = 352 bits (44*3) (actually half, represented using 7 char)
Huffman length = 116 bits
# Questions

By definition, I would think that lossless compression has onto mapping
Is this true?
