# Graph Important Applications

## Using DFS and BFS

1. Testing whether graph is connected
2. Finding Shortest Paths
- dfs is a lot of work to tweak to find this
- bfs is fast, as using nodes u, v
    - covers neighbors of u, then neighbors 2 hops from u,
    - stops when it returns v
3. Computing the connected components
4. Computing the diameter
