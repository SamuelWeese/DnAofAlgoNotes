### Computing Time
not time complexity, maybe on friday
Covering the basics
## Basics
Depends on an inputs (n)

Ken Burmans slides are ok in terms of flow and concept,
- they do have a couple of mistakes, be careful

Time is dependant upon size of input (n)

 Two types of operations
 - addition, multiplications


prime 100 digit number -> can remove composed numbers
best case complexity
wost case complexity
average case complexity

# Best Case Complexity
tau is number of operations performed by an input to get the desired output
I = inputs of size n
Italic I_n = infinte set n
B(n) = min(tau(I)|I in L_n)
-> fewest number of operations in tau(I) or I in I_n

# Worst Case Complexity

W(n) = max(tau(I)|I in I_n)


# Example
n = 3

set of all possible inputs = [1,2,3][3,2,1][4,5,6][1,1,6][9,8,7] ... ect
how many operations to sort this?
n-1 swaps


# Real world examples
A(n) = E(tau)
E(tau) is expected value

D = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
{1/6, 1/6 ... 1/6}
E[D] = 1/6*1+2/6-1/6*6

Sigma(P_d * D)
d e D
        w(n)
A(n) = sigma ip_i
        i=B(n)

p_i i s the probability of having that many operations
Start from B(n) (best) -> to the maximum number of operations

```
function LinearSearch (L[0:n – 1],X)
Input: L[0:n – 1] (a list of size n), X (a search item)
Output: returns index of first occurrence of X in the
list, or -1 if X is not in the list
for i ← 0 to n – 1 do
if (X = L[i]) then
return(i)
endif
endfor
return(-1)
end LinearSearch
```

[8,7,12,8,19,12,5]
checks all numbers before returning false (-1) when searching for 6

sorted list does not have this issue

number of basic operations is N, not the list for actual time speed

A(n) =
```

```
Distribution depends on Distribution of input

Closed form formula -> calculus 2 problem
average complexity is 


```
function BinarySearch (L[0:n – 1],X)
Input: L[0:n – 1] (a sorted array of n list elements)
X (a search item)
Output: returns the index of an occurrence of X in the list, or -1 if X is not in the list
Found ← .false.
low ← 0
high ← n – 1
while .not. Found .and. low ≤ high do
mid ← ¬(low + high)/2¼
if X = L[mid] then Found ← .true.
else if X < L[mid] then
high ← mid – 1
else
low ← mid + 1
endif
endif
endwhile
if Found then
return(mid)
else
return(-1)
endif
end BinarySearch
```
