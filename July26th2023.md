# Convolusion

Use divide and conquor

# FFT and dft


# Nth Root of Unity
X^n = 1

look at 2pi/n on unity circle

omega_n = cos(2pi/n) + i*sin(2pi/n)

# FFT Stuff
n = 2^k
we pad n with 0's until we have a power of 2 -> 3 terms becomes 4
-> 5 terms (x^4 largest) becomes 6 (0x^5)
-> constant is included with our number of terms, if no constant (x^0) we add 0
we want polynomials of 2^(k-1)

We take DFT_omega_n (P(x)) = (P(1), P(omega_n), P(omega_n^2) ... P(omega_n^n-1))

# Discrete Forier Transform

Example:

P(x) = 1 - 2x + 3x^2 + 6x^3 -> 4 terms
roots of unity: 1, i, -1, -i
P(1) = 8
P(i) = 1 - 2i + 3(-1) + 6(i)
P(-1) = 0
P(-i) 1 + 2i + 3(-1) + 6(-i)(-1)
= -2 + 8i

DFT_omega_n(P(x)) = [8, -2-8i, 0, -2+8i]

Van Der Monde Matrix

Inverse is 1/n (F(1/omega_n))

Matrix whose ith coefficent is (1/omega_n)(i-1)(j-1)

# New approach
P(x), Q(x) -> P(x)*Q(x) -> n^1.58 -> n log_2 n
P(x), Q(x) -> compute dft

DFT_omega_n(P(x)) = [...]
DFT_omega_n(Q(x)) = [...]

Multiply vectors component wise

apply inverse DFT, x by 1/n F(omega_n^-1)

Using forier transform and inverse forier transform to get final product

DFT vs FFT yield different due to rounding issues purely

# FFT Example

## Doing DFT first
1 + x^2 + 9x^3

[1, 0, 1, 9] * [1...(i^3)^3] = [11, -9i, -7, 9i]

Component wise mulitply
[8, -2 -8i, 0, -2 + 8i] [11, -9i, -7, 9i] = [88, -72 + 18i, 0, 72 - 18i]

## Note: Badri said he messed up, needed to 0 pad up to edge



Strict polynomial Multiplication
(1 - 2x + 4x^2 + 13x^3 - 15 x^4 + 33x^5 + 54x^6)
