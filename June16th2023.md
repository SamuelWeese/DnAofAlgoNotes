Proposition 4.2.6
Every binary tree with L leaf nodes has depth d at leas log_2 L
Further, equality is acheived for the complete binary tree
L = # of leaves

Count number of children (decendants) is over counting number of leaves
Max num descendants = 2^d

SO d >= ceil(log_2(L))

Binary Search Trees

Assignement 2 is next Saturday

Assignment 3 is trees

# Binary Search Tree
Left is lower, right is higher by default (child to parent relationship)
We have already covered insertion and deletion

Inbalance in search tree is fine
Inorder traversal to replace this

# Red Black Trees
Root is always black

Every node is either red or black.
All NIL nodes (figure 1) are considered black.
A red node does not have a red child.
Every path from a given node to any of its descendant NIL nodes goes through the same number of black nodes.
(Conclusion) If a node N has exactly one child, it must be a red child, because if it were black, its NIL descendants would sit at a different black depth than N's NIL child, violating requirement 4.

Red Black trees are good for creating well-balanced trees. The major problem with binary search trees is that you can make them unbalanced very easily. Imagine your first number is a 15. Then all the numbers after that are increasingly smaller than 15. You'll have a tree that is very heavy on the left side and has nothing on the right side.

Red Black trees solve that by forcing your tree to be balanced whenever you insert or delete. It accomplishes this through a series of rotations between ancestor nodes and child nodes. The algorithm is actually pretty straightforward, although it is a bit long. I'd suggest picking up the CLRS (Cormen, Lieserson, Rivest and Stein) textbook, "Introduction to Algorithms" and reading up on RB Trees.

The implementation is also not really so short so it's probably not really best to include it here. Nevertheless, trees are used extensively for high performance apps that need access to lots of data. They provide a very efficient way of finding nodes, with a relatively small overhead of insertion/deletion. Again, I'd suggest looking at CLRS to read up on how they're used.

While BSTs may not be used explicitly - one example of the use of trees in general are in almost every single modern RDBMS. Similarly, your file system is almost certainly represented as some sort of tree structure, and files are likewise indexed that way. Trees power Google. Trees power just about every website on the internet.

Depth of RBT is O(log_n)

d <= 2(k-1)
d >= k-1


W(n) = 2(k-1) = 2^n
