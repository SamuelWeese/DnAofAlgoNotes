m1 = (a00 + a11)*(b00 + b11)
m2 = (a10 + a11) + b00
m3 = a00 * (b01 - b11)
m4 = a11 * (b10 - b00)
m5 = (a00 + a01)*b11
m6 = (a10 - a00)*(b00 + b10)
m7 = (a01 - a11)*(b10 + b11)

# Recurance Relation

Complexity is w(n) = 7(n/2) for n >= 2; 1 for n=1

Results in 7^k w(1)
k = log_2 n
n^k,
n^log_2 7

Pan's algrotihm is O(n^2.795) on 70x70 (does not matter)


C = AB = []
m1 + m4

# Space vs Time Complexity
Course doesn't cover Space
Hard to quantify unless we are talking about individual pieces of hardware
Space can be reused, time is only spent once


# Complex numbers
Mother is sqrt(-1) or i

It allows us to calculate

# Roots
p(x) = a0 + a1x + a2x^2 ... anx^n

A root is a number which satisfies p(x) for p(x) == 0
Maximum of n real roots
Not always n roots

unity x^n as n approaches inf

z such that |z| = 1

unit circle
360/n = 2pi/n (degree vs radians)

omega_n = cos(2pi/n) + i*sin(2pi/n)

# Forier Transforms
integral of e^it
dft is integral of xn * e^(-i(2pi)/N)*kn
for N complex numbers,

Could you explain a ring? Specifically necessity
