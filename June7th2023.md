## HW
Effiient is more than the lay persons views
- not expecting most efficient

Q1 worst case pair is n and 2?
since n is smallest value so most steps to reduce before recursion
but 1 returns 1 immediatly nvm oooooh

## Example 1
a) T(n) = { 3 T(n/2)+n n > 1
        1 n=1
        }

b) T(n) = { n T(n/2) n > 1
        1 n= 1}


a) answer -> [image]

b) answer -> [image]
learn geometric series formula
learn calc 2 series formulas
