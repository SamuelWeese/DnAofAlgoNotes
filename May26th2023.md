### Asymptotics
## For the reader: ChatGPT can render this text into latex if you ask it to (extremely well)


# Order formula
# initial problem
# eq1
L(n) = log(n!) for theta (n*log(n))

= log 1 + log 2 + log 3 ... log n

#  Upper bound
bounded upper by n log(n) -> big O(n log(n))

# SW Question
is it possible to bound it by O (n log n/2 + 1) instead of n log n?
yes, but n log n is sufficient

# Lower bound

drop smallest not the largest -> general rule for

instead of

(n-1) log (n)
use
n log n - log (1)

# i lower bound
log(i+1) + log(i+2) ... log(n)

.>= log(i+1) ... log(i+1) (n-1 terms in this set)

L(n) >= (n-i) log (i+1) for any 1 <= i <= n

L(n) for theta (n log(n)) >= n/2 log (n/2 +1)  

### S(n,k)

Function aprox to n^(k+1) / k + 1
S(n,k) =

1^k + 2^k + ... + n^k

## Upper bound

integral(x^k dx)|n,0

= n^k+1 / k + 1 |n,0

= n^k / k+1

## General rule:
when having an integral that looks simmilar to your function, use sandwiching
otherwise, use upper and lower limits

## Sandwiching (riemann sums)
y = f(x) = f(x) = x^k

area under curve on board = integral(x^k dx)|n,0
= n^k+1 / k+1

board displays riemann sum (left and right) from 0 ... n where x is moving towards n

g_a is red, g_b is blue

g_b (x) <= x^k <= g_a(x)

figure out the road map from left hand side to right hand side

red area is S(n+1,k)
blue is S(n-1,k)

from this we can see that this is asymtotically equivalant

# Limit test for this

S(n,k) / (n^k+1 / k+1) <= (n^k+1/k+1 + n^k) / (n^k+1 / k+1)

1 <= S(n,k)/(n^k+1 / k+1) = 1+(k+1 / n)

not expected to get answer without the whole equation

n log(n) vs

undercounting vs overcounting for the riemann sum
in this course we have a sum we approximate with integrals, instead of integrals
