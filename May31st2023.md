### Lower bound comparisons for sorting algorithms
given any sorting algorithm (comparison based)
- worst case complexity is theta of n log n
- assumption "contains n elements"
- assumption "elements are distinct"
- not talking about one specific algorithm, all people can think of (merge, quick, ect)
-Algorithm will generally compare swap compare recursively
List of Natural Numbers
- only work with inputs 1 to n
- index starting at 1, last index is n (size of inputs)
- n factorial lists possible
IE (1,8,2,10,7) -> (1,3,2,5,4) if ordered by ascending value
# List of size 3 example
- 3! = 6 for num of Permutations



```
Permutations:
[1 3 2]
[1 2 3]
[2 3 1]
[2 1 3]
[3 1 2]
[3 2 1]
```
Algo X
swap a specific pair
return the specific pair

Subset of inputs
4 different subsets of 6 inputs
bag of 6 list broken down into

identity emerges at which pair is selected for the binary tree of swaps

mapping for algo x algo classifications is onto
Badri pruned non used done!s (of length 3 and 4)
Every input list has 3 worst sort, as path of length 3 is the longest
Binary tree of depth D
- width of 2^D leaves of depth D
-
Algo X has worst case complexity L
- binary tree representation has depth L
- 2^L final results at MOST
    - pruning
    - number of inputs is equal to the number of leaves
- 2^L is at least n! due to number of inputs equal to number of leaves
- THEREFORE :
<mark>
l >, log_2 (n!)
l is to theta(n log_2 n)
</mark>

# Recurence Relation
You only know dsp noise definition
Definition:

Binary Search:
Makes Two Comparisons
- (=, >)
recusive call with sublist size (n-1)/2 = 2^k-1 - 1

W(n) = W(n-1/2) + 2
- W(n) = worst case completxity of big search
- best case of size 1 is 2, 2log1 and also checking for which way we should swap

Solve : W(n)
PDF:
{ W(n) ~= W(n-1/2)+2
    ~= W(n/2) + 2
    W(1) = 2
    W(0) = 0
}

PDF 2:
{
W(n) = W(n/2) + 2
    = W(n/2^(2)) + 2(2)
    = W(n/2^(3)) + 2(3)
    ... ect
    = W(n/2^k) + 2(k) <- general case

}
k ~= log_2(n)
2^n -1 for worst case
PDF 3:
{
W(n) = W(n/a) + 2
    = W(n/a^(2)) + b*2
    = W(n/a^(3)) + b*3
    ... ect
    = W(n/a^k) + b*k <- general case
}

final: w(n) ~= b * log_a (n)
